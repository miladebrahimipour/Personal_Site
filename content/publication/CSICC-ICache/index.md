# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this paper, we propose an Instruction Set Encoding technique to improve the lifetime reliability of instruction cache.
To this end, the consecutive replacement among instructions is analyzed and represented quantitatively in a graph called the aging-aware replacement graph of instructions. Using this graph in the second phase, the task of determining aging-aware optimal encoding is done using a heuristic-based optimization method."
