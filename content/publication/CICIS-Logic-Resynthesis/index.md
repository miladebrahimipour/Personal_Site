abstract: "With the advancement of technology and the reduction of transistor dimensions, new challenges have arisen in the reliability of Integrated Circuits. One of these challenges is transistor aging, which results in circuit performance degradation over time and eventually leads to lifetime reduction of the circuit. So far, various methods have been proposed using the Logic Resynthesis technique to reduce the effects of aging in a circuit. But the main problem with these methods is that they have a high runtime and are not applicable to large-scale circuits. In this paper, a partitioning-based logic resynthesis method is proposed to reduce the performance degradation caused by aging phenomenon in a digital circuit, which effectively reduces the execution time of the optimization process. In the proposed method, the circuit is divided into a set of smaller sub-circuits using cone structures. Then these sub-circuits are leveled and a subset of the most effective sub-circuits is selected for optimization. Finally, a logical resynthesis technique is applied to each sub-circuit which reduces the execution time of the algorithm. Also, by using the created sub-circuits, an attempt has been made to reduce the time overhead caused by recalculating the circuit delay after each round of the optimization process. The simulation results show that the proposed method with an overhead area of ​​4.26% has reduced the efficiency reduction due to aging by about 14.8%."
