I received my Masters in Computer Engineering, Computer Architecture major, from the Department of Computer Engineering ([CE](https://ce.uk.ac.ir/en/home)) at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman ([SBUK](https://uk.ac.ir/en/home)) under the supervision of professor [Behnam Ghavami](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a0vk8BkAAAAJ&hl=en) in February 2019. Prior to that, I did my Bachelors in Computer Engineering, Computer Hardware, at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman in July 2016. 

My research focuses on Computer Architecture, VLSI Design, Robust and Reliable Integrated Circuits Design, FPGA and Reconfigurable Systems, Electronic Design Automation, System Level Electronic Design, and Deep Learning Accelerators. Currently, I am working on Fault Tolerance of Deep learning Accelerators.

I also have a great passion for teaching and am constantly involved in academic and departmental activities - supervising undergraduate courses and final year projects (+500h and ~120 students).
